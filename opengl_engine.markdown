# Simple Graphics Engine in OpenGL

![OpenGL engine screenshot 2024.07.31](/graphics/opengl_engine-2024.07.31.png "OpenGL engine screenshot")

This is my first ground-up, solo graphics project. I began by following learnopengl.com, which taught me the basics of implementing real-time rendering concepts using the OpenGL API.

Features:
* Deferred rendering
* 3D model loading (.obj, .3mf)
* Simple 3D geometry (Cube, Sphere)
* Multiple light sources
* Shadow mapping
* SSAO
* Postprocessing (HDR tone mapping, Bloom, FXAA)
* Interactive camera

To-do:
* Shadow mapping for more light sources
* Light volumes
* PBR
* ImGui integration
* Blending
* PhysX integration
